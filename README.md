# 🌱 C Language Journey — Learning C from Scratch

Hi! I'm Bhavya Tripathy, a first-year CS student, and this is my personal journey of **learning the C programming language from the ground up.**

This repository is where I:
- 📚 Learn new C concepts
- 💻 Write and test actual programs
- ✍️ Take clean notes in markdown
- 🔁 Push my progress step-by-step on GitHub

> 🧠 I'm not an expert — I'm a student learning by doing.  
> Everything here is raw, real, and fully built from scratch.

## 📌 About This Repo

This is a **live learning journal**, not just a code dump.  
Each folder contains:
- ✅ `.c` programs with full comments  
- ✅ `.md` notes like mini cheat-sheets  
- ✅ Git commits showing what I’ve learned, when

Everything is beginner-friendly and written to **teach myself**, not just pass exams.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

| Folder | Topic |
|--------|-------|
| `01_hello_world/` | First program + VS Code setup |
| `02_variables_and_datatypes/` | Declaring variables, types, printing values |
| `03_conditions_and_loops/` | If/else, switch, for/while/do-while |
| `keywords_reference/` | Markdown file of all 32 keywords in C |

> More folders coming soon: arrays, functions, pointers, memory diagrams...

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

- 🧱 I want to build a **strong foundation** in C
- ✍️ I retain better when I write + code + explain it myself
- 🧰 I want a repo that grows with me — not something copied from tutorials
- 🚀 I’m building habits that will help me with DSA, systems, and big projects later

---

## ⚙️ Tools I'm Using

- 💻 Language: C (GCC compiler)
- 🧠 IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- 📘 Notes: Markdown (`.md` files)
- 🗂️ Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## 🧾 Sample Program Style

```c
// Example: hello.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
````

> Simple, clean, and always commented.

## 📚 This Repo Is My...

* Textbook
* Code playground
* Revision guide
* Showcase of effort
* Daily log of how far I’ve come

If you're also learning C, feel free to use this as a reference or fork it to build your own version.

## ✍️ About Me

I'm a first-year CS student at MUJ.
I’m also a writer, a poet, and a dreamer — working on a novel and a startup while learning to code from scratch.

🧠 My goals:

* Build a deep understanding of CS fundamentals
* Land a top placement (₹20 LPA+)
* Create tools, stories, and software that last

## 🌻 Thanks for Visiting

> This is just the beginning.
> Learning C is my first brick in a bigger foundation I'm building.
> I'm documenting it all — honestly, patiently, consistently.

If you're learning too, you're not alone 🤍
