Basic data types in C

1. int → whole numbers (e.g., age)
2. float → decimal numbers, single precision (e.g., temperature)
3. double → decimal numbers, double precision (e.g., pi)
4. char → single character (e.g., grade)

Input & Output in C

1. scanf() → takes input from user
2. printf() → prints to screen

Memory size of types
sizeof(type) → tells how many bytes that type uses in memory on your system

Format Specifiers:

1. %d → integer
2. %f → float
3. %lf → double
4. %c → character

Address-of operator (&) → passes the memory location to scanf()

The space " %c" before %c prevents leftover \n from being read as input.
